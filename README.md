# AssassinShadowPatcher
A simple program for improving the quality of shadows in Assassin's Creed Revelations.

### How to use

1. Select the game executable using the appropriate button.
2. Click Patch.
3. Enjoy!

Note: The program creates a copy of the original executable so that it can be restored easily at any time.

When patched shadow quality settings will have no effect, you'll see this:
